After taking on the daunting task of hosting the 87th Annual Academy Awards — and following funnywoman <strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong> — the How I Met Your Mother alum didn’t get the best of reviews. Because of that, the actor admitted to <a href=#>The Huffington Post</a> he doesn’t think round two is in his future.&nbsp;</p><p>"I don’t know that my family nor my soul could take it,” the dad to twins <strong>Harper</strong> and <strong>Gideon </strong>told the site. "It’s a beast. It was fun to check off the list, but for the amount of time spent and the understandable opinionated response, I don’t know that it's a delightful balance to do every year or even again."&nbsp;</p><p>The Tony winner admitted he, of course, looked at the feedback online but didn’t linger too long.</p><p>“I didn’t keep up with it obsessively, but it was interesting to see just what people thought landed and didn’t,” he said, before somewhat defending himself. “It’s so difficult for one who’s simply watching the show to realize just how much time and concession and compromise and explanation has gone into almost every single thing. Every joke. Wording of joke. Placement of joke. Canceling of joke. Embellishment for just one line. And I'm not saying that to defend everything I said as if it was the absolute best choice, but it’s also an award show, and you’re powering through 14 acts filled with 20 plus awards. So my job was to try and keep things as light and specific to this year’s set of films as possible. And if people are critical of that, it’s a big giant platform, so I would assume that they would be.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for how NPH, 41, himself thought he did? He’s happy about it.</p><p>“I was glad we got through it, and I thought that those in the audience at the Dolby [Theatre] seemed to be enjoying themselves more as the show went on, when I was told that the opposite would be true,” he explained. “I was told that as the room fills, with you know it's four-fifths of the room didn’t win, and you get further into the award giving they get less enthusiastic and less excited. And I felt while we were doing it that people were enjoying themselves more and more, so for that I’m happy.”</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Would you like to see Neil Patrick Harris host again?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKWeoZxivaLA0aKapGWYlr%2BztdJmm6ido6PBbsDHoqWkZZiaeqS71KWbZqCRo7GtsYyhpqysmaO0brvSnJirq12WtKK1zWZpaWllaoA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-lowe-bio-age-boyfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Lowe Bio, Age, Boyfriend, Net Worth</span></a>
