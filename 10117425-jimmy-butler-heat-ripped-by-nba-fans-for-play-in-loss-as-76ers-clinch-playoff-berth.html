But the air steadily went out of the balloon in the second half.</p><p>Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro combined for 44 points on 14-of-45 shooting. Bam Adebayo's 10 points were well below his season average (19.3). The absences of Duncan Robinson and Terry Rozier were certainly felt as the Heat became far too dependent on Herro down the stretch.</p>michael doleac <span class=acct>@3MWD__</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>heat: "tyler pass the ball, we can tie the game" &lt;br>&lt;br>herro: &lt;a href="https://t.co/RNmWC4f0m3">pic.twitter.com/RNmWC4f0m3&lt;/a></p>‏ً <span class=acct>@cookedbylbj</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>"TYLER HERRO FOR THE TIE" &lt;a href="https://t.co/7p4Z4n0737">pic.twitter.com/7p4Z4n0737&lt;/a></p>Hardwood Paroxysm <span class=acct>@HPbasketball</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>There will have to be some conversations about the Tyler Herro thing again.</p>Chris Vernon <span class=acct>@ChrisVernonShow</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>took em a while to realize jimmy can hardly run and was just corner decoy whole 4th - but finally moving Batum over to Herro was critical. forced the backcourt - then got the block as Heat ran all thru Herro. What a monster game for Batum.</p><p>We've been in this situation before, writing obituaries for the Heat following a play-in defeat. This does feel a little different, though, with Butler a year older and the injuries piling up for head coach Erik Spoelstra. There's only so much he can do to scheme around the squad's obvious flaws.</p>Omar Kelly <span class=acct>@OmarKelly</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jimmy Butler's hurt. &lt;a href="https://t.co/kZz0Az4An2">pic.twitter.com/kZz0Az4An2&lt;/a></p>Will Manso <span class=acct>@WillManso</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm not sure why Heat are setting up a 3 there.

See yall for the 2024-2025 season. For some reason the Basketball Gods just hate Miami. Could be for what they did to DWade. Could be for how they did Bron. Could be because they decided to hang up Jordan's jersey. Who knows. But they just don't like Miami.</p>owen <span class=acct>@joemazzulla</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>heat fans on the other side of the role player unable to miss postseason game &lt;a href="https://t.co/jKz1nZDwZe">https://t.co/jKz1nZDwZe&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/hj163pl191">pic.twitter.com/hj163pl191&lt;/a></p>‏ً <span class=acct>@FanMahome</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sending the Heat into rebuild in a week&lt;br> &lt;a href="https://t.co/HDeR38VYLM">pic.twitter.com/HDeR38VYLM&lt;/a></p><p>The Heat await the winner of the other play-in matchup, which features the Atlanta Hawks and Chicago Bulls. You'd favor Miami in a must-win situation against either opponent, and the franchise's 2023 Finals run was a reminder of how this team historically performs its best with its back against the wall.</p><p>In a few weeks, we could all be marveling at how Spoelstra once again orchestrated an upset of the Eastern Conference's top seed. The Heat are one of the few teams that earn some benefit of the doubt amid the situation they're facing.</p><p>But a different team from the one that played Wednesday night will need to show up against the Boston Celtics in the first round, assuming Miami even gets that far.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWyBc4GMo6Cmpalir7bAy56pZqCVlsFuvsipp56cXZfGbrrBmmSfmZ6oeqe70WanpZmpYravecuoqqxlkah6eILEq6pmm5yeu6S0jKmjmrGfm7NursSrq6E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10096075-mlb-rumors-justin-turner-blue-jays-agree-to-contract-after-declining-red-sox-option.html><span>←</span><span>MLB Rumors: Justin Turner, Blue Jays Agree to Contract After Declining Red Sox Option | News, Scores</span></a>
