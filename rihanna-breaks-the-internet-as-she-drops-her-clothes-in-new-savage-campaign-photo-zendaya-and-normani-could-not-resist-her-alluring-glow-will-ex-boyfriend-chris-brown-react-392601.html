In four hours, it received over 5 million Likes on Instagram. Celebrities like Zendaya, Tinashe, Kash Doll, and Normani rushed to voice their love and support. A few of those famous ladies work with RiRi as ambassadors for the brand.</p><p>Some people say that the image is so appealing that her ex-boyfriend, Chris Bown, might not be able to resist commenting and telling the world how he feels about it.</p><p>Fans are over the moon with the latest image. One of them wrote: “Rihanna is the bhaddest female in the hip hop industry.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B_dH6T-nXZh/</p><p>A fan of feminine curves chimed in: “So nice to see a female body that isn’t covered in cellulite or full of injections.”</p><p>A huge supporter of the “Work” singer added: “Disrespect will not be received about the richest female musician, most influential female artist of the decade, highest certified female artist, humanitarian, billion-dollar brand QUEEN.”</p><p>A follower made this interesting observation: “It’s interesting how if Kim K drops something day after Beyoncé everyone ready to call her out. But when Rihanna does it, everyone is silent?! 🤔🤔🤔🐝🐝🐝.”</p><p>A fifth comment read: “SEE y’all “lOvE” Rihanna so much but once they put the spotlight on Beyoncé y’all talking bout “sHE AiNt gOd” “oVErRraTeD” like wtf y’all just be hating on Beyoncé for no reason I swear.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B_nrbNPndh0/</p><p>Rihanna is working hard right now, so she can focus on having a family later on. She recently stated: “Since I turned 32, I’m realizing life is really short. You don’t have a lot of time to tolerate s—t, you know? You put so much on your plate. … And I’m overwhelmed too much. What’s happening now is that I’m going back to black and white. My grey area is shutting down.”</p><p>This woman is unstoppable, and many of her supporters believe this is just the beginning of something even greater.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinrWius2aZJuqlZa4tHnToZxmoZ6psrO6xK1kmqtdqLWmecOrpqmrXZ2ys3nCpaatoJWoeqq6jKecsGWjlsOis8RmmpqloJa2qLqMqZ%2BorJ9ix6a6w5qwmmWRo7Fuus6rpJqmmWKwsMHLnWSnp6Riv6a%2FyKyrZqCVp3qiuMuuqaKml2K0rbvWZq6ipJxisrl5waiwn6qZmrulecKhqaKrXZe%2FsMPNZqmemZOpenSFkW9namc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./160455-womans-traditional-wedding-dress-mzansi-women-blown-away.html><span>←</span><span>Womans Traditional Zulu-Inspired Wedding Dress With Cow Skin Bodice Leaves Mzansi Ladies Blown Aw</span></a>
