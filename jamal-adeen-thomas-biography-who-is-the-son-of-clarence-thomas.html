He became kind of a leading troll and took a lot of shots at individuals.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘There is a great divide on how Rory is viewed. I respect Rory because he was willing to say out loud what a lot of people were thinking and he showed a lot of courage and conviction. Unfortunately for Rory, he is also an idealist and he thought he was fighting for something larger than himself.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Then the money guys came in — Jimmy Dunne and Ed Herlihy [PGA Tour directors] — and they completely sold him out and kind of broke his heart. Rory learnt a hard lesson about the real world. Idealism only goes so far and money always wins.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Jimmy Dunne is a friend and adviser to Rory going back a long way. He got Rory’s dad into Seminole Golf Club, one of the inner sanctums of golf — Gerry McIlroy was a former bartender and that does not fit the normal Seminole member profile. That was all Jimmy Dunne and yet it was also Jimmy Dunne, in secret, who cold-bloodedly crushed Rory’s hopes and dreams with this [framework] deal.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>McIlroy’s fate was made even more heartbreaking by the reported barbs from his fellow professionals.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Shipnuck claimed that an anonymous Ryder Cup player said: ‘F*** Rory. I’m so sick of hearing how he’s some kind of hero who is saving golf. He’s bought and paid for like everybody else. It’s just his money is coming from the other side.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Rory’s fighting so hard for the [PGA] Tour because he wants to preserve his income streams, not because he cares about the Tour itself. That he is being held up as some sort of savior on Twitter and by all the fanboys with their shitty podcasts tells you how little people really understand what’s going on.’</p><img decoding=async id=i-2a4861bcb4729f12 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/16/21/76629387-0-image-m-29_1697486938612.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Shipnuck claimed Jimmy Dunne (pictured) 'crushed McIlroy's hopes and dreams'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Shipnuck claimed Jimmy Dunne (pictured) ‘crushed McIlroy’s hopes and dreams’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Shipnuck’s snippets from behind-the-scenes of golf’s nasty divorce, including the jibe from the Ryder Cup player and a previous claim that Brooks Koepka directed an ‘f*** all those country club kids’ barb towards Justin Thomas and co., have drawn the ire of some players.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’d like to speak on behalf of a lot of Tour players and say we’re sick of Alan Shipnuck doing what he does,’ Thomas wrote on X. ‘Bring positivity and good stories to help grow the game of golf, not try and make money bashing guys, earning zero trust, with a lot of incorrect information. Ridiculous.’ Koepka added: ‘And LIV players.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Shipnuck has brushed off their complaints, calling out players for wanting fame without the scrutiny that comes with it.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘That was so interesting and enlightening,’ he said in response to Thomas’s spiel. ‘We are in the most volatile moment in the history of professional golf, and there’s been two years of finger-pointing and name-calling, and his critique is I’m not writing more positive stories. I didn’t create this situation, I’m just recording it. These pro golfers want money and fame but don’t want the scrutiny.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He also hit back at their claims that he is profiting for ‘bashing’ players, pulling on heartstrings in a similar way to Koepka’s attempts to justify his LIV Golf defection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Players become so voracious and if anybody else tries to get a few crumbs you’re a bad guy. I have four kids to put through college and I write books for a living. I don’t think I need to apologize for that to Justin Thomas. It’s never enough for these players. It’s a bottomless pit.’</p><img decoding=async id=i-5095498c27668abd src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/16/21/76628509-0-image-m-30_1697487139061.jpg height=425 width=306 alt="Brooks Koepka" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><img decoding=async id=i-7a30d08ac5b73ea4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/16/21/76628511-0-image-m-32_1697487148772.jpg height=425 width=306 alt="Justin Thomas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>The author also brushed off complaints from Brooks Koepka (left) and Justin Thomas (right)&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to Shipnuck’s book, 33-year-old Koepka is said to have offered a heartfelt explanation from jumping ship from the PGA Tour.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘“You think I give a f*** what they think?
