She grew up in Massachusetts, US, alongside her siblings, the youngest being Nella. Stanzi bagged a Bachelor of <a href=#>Arts degree</a> from the University of Massachusetts, Boston, in 2018. She also attended the William Esperanto Studios in New York in 2019 for six weeks of intensive training in acting.</p><h3>When is Stanzi Potenza's birthday?</h3><p class=align-left>The multitalented artist celebrates her birthday on 17 October every year. She was born on 17 October 1995 in Massachusetts, United States of America.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/627fabe43f5c58ab.jpg><h3>What is Stanzi Potenza's real name?</h3><p class=align-left>The social media celebrity's birth-given name is Stanzi Potenza, although she goes by different names, the most common being<i> The sketch comedian from hell</i> on social media.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>The sketch comedian from hell has always felt at home in acting since she was five. This love for dramatising began after her parents divorced. Her mother would take her and the other siblings to the theatre when the babysitters did not show up. She began to develop a keen interest as she watched the actresses change in the costume room, and before long, Stanzi started to appear in some plays.</p><p class=align-left>After graduating from the University of Massachusetts, Boston, the comedian decided to hone her acting skills by <a href=#>taking acting lessons</a> at the William Esperanto Studios in New York. She planned to return to her hometown in Massachusetts after this. Still, she got stuck in Boston because of the lockdown that grew out of the necessity to curb the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. This was the beginning of everything Stanzi is currently <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">popularly known for</a> on the internet.</p><p class=align-left>Stanzi started sharing 60 seconds of comical skits on TikTok to overcome boredom and use the advice of friends who believed she could make a career out of standup comedy. The content received positive feedback from her audience, and before long, she posted several videos in a week while gaining more followers.</p><p class=align-left>The sketch comedian from hell now produces several short videos for her teeming fans. Some of the series include:</p><ul><li><i>Heaven and Hell;</i></li><li><i>Family Dinners;</i></li><li><i>Makeup;</i></li><li><i>TokTober;</i></li><li><i>Civil War Love;</i></li><li><i>Duke Blackwell;</i></li><li><i>Auntie Stan;</i></li><li><i>Call Out News;</i></li><li><i>Kidnapping Series.</i></li></ul><h2>Stanzi Potenza's ex-boyfriend</h2><p class=align-left>The social media celebrity is not known to mix her private life with her career as a content creator, which means many <a href=#>people</a> do not know her dating history. However, Stanzi insinuated that she had a partner, a musician who wrote a whole album about her. She has refused to give out the ex's name and the album.</p><h2>Social media presence</h2><p class=align-left>Stanzi Potenza's TikTok followers are<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> around 3.6 million</a>, and she has garnered over 180 million likes on her videos as of 13 December 2022. As her popularity grew on TikTok, so did her network, and she got life-changing advice from another content creator, Hassan Khadair, on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">exploring the YouTube platform</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The content creator now has close to 1.5 million subscribers on her self-titled YouTube channel. She has posted over 500 videos and garnered almost 650 million views.</p><p class=align-left>Stanzi Potenza's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Podcast journey</a> is also an essential aspect of her career as a content creator. She hosts a podcast series titled <i>What Fresh Hell is This?</i> and treats her audience to a good laugh.</p><p class=align-left>However, Stanzi Potenza's Twitter following pales in comparison to other platforms. She has less than 50,000 followers on the platform as of 13 December 2022.</p><h2>Net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Stanzi's exact net worth is unknown, but it can be confirmed that she has created multiple sources of income for herself. Her popularity has helped her sign endorsement deals with brands, some of whom she models for.</p><p class=align-left>She is also an entrepreneur and has an online merchandise store where customised products like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Stanzi Potenza's jacket</a> are sold. These jackets have various inscriptions that can be associated with her series.</p><p class=align-left>An outsider may think that Stanzi Potenza became a social media celebrity overnight, but she did a lot of work to get to where she is today. She did not limit herself to sketch comedy alone but also had to learn how to edit her videos, although she now has a whole team working with her.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Madeline Robbie Schneider's bio, age, career, profile, net worth</a></p><p class=align-left>In a published article on <strong>We,</strong> Madeline Robbie Schneider is a celebrity kid whose popularity in the media lies on her father's status in the American <a href=#>entertainment</a> industry.</p><p class=align-left>Most of the findings about her are gleaned from the interviews granted by the adults in her immediate family and people's posts about her on social media pages.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfKetwq2qZqSZm7KprcKkqmiblaGyo77IraCeq12XtrCz0ZqnoaGVqHxygJdpbW1lp528br%2FTmqWzoV2lvLWxzbOYZpmXmnqju9ifqaKdnpl6sbvDnJisrF2YrrOxxKtknpylmK61tc6nZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maisy-stella.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Maisy Stella Age - Bio, Wiki, Height, Net Worth, Relationship (2023)</span></a>
