His contract had a $13.4 million player option for a second season, but he <a href=# rel=noopener>declined</a> it on Nov. 3.</p><p>There was some risk for the 39-year-old<b> </b>to turn down that much guaranteed money, but his steady presence over the course of his career gave him plenty of leverage in contract negotiations.</p><p>Turner hit .276/.345/.455 with 23 homers and 96 RBI in 146 games for the Red Sox. It was the seventh consecutive season he's had a batting average of at least .270, on-base percentage of at least .340 and slugging percentage of at least .430.</p><p>At this stage of his career, Turner is probably best suited to be a first baseman or designated hitter. He had a minus-five outs above average <a href=# rel=noopener>rating</a> last season, worst of his career since MLB began tracking the metric in 2016.</p><p>As long as Turner can maintain his offensive performance at this late stage of his career, the Blue Jays<b> </b>will have no problem getting a good value for its investment. He <a href=# rel=noopener>ranked</a> in the 86th percentile of all players in batting run average and 91st percentile in whiff rate.</p><p>Turner's barrel rate was only 5.7 percent, leaving open the possibility that his power production will decrease away from the small left field at Fenway Park.</p><p>But a player who makes contact and draws walks at the rate Turner is able to do can be an impact hitter in any lineup.</p><p>Despite making the playoffs in each of the past two seasons, the Blue Jays have been trending in the wrong direction. Some of their key players have either regressed due to age or haven't developed as expected after previous breakout years.</p><p>Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is still a solid player, but he hasn't played at the same level since finishing second in AL MVP voting in 2021. Cavan Biggio has been a <a href=# rel=noopener>below-average</a> hitter by OPS+ in each of the past three seasons.</p><p>George Springer's 102 OPS+ in 2023 was the <a href=# rel=noopener>worst</a> of his career. Matt Chapman and Brandon Belt are free agents.</p><p>At this stage of his career, Turner doesn't answer all of the questions facing Toronto's roster, but he will certainly help the offense if he remains healthy.</p><p>As long as the Blue Jays don't ask Turner to overextend himself, he can make a difference for them in a loaded American League East.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWt9eIGMpqObZaKqurC%2B0mahrquknrtuwNSrpZ6qXZe5trGMo5iyq12WtLOxxGarqGWTpLu1vsCcq2aZlqmys3nDnpqloZ6eu6h50Z6bZqufrXqwvNOipqc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rihanna-breaks-the-internet-as-she-drops-her-clothes-in-new-savage-campaign-photo-zendaya-and-normani-could-not-resist-her-alluring-glow-will-ex-boyfriend-chris-brown-react-392601.html><span>←</span><span>Rihanna Breaks The Internet As She Drops Her Clothes In New Savage Campaign Photo Zendaya And No</span></a>
