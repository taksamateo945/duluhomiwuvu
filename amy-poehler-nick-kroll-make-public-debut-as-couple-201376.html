<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Amy Poehler Nick Kroll Dating: Couple Makes Public Debut in Photo</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It's official! <a href=#><strong>Amy Poehler </strong></a>and <strong>Nick Kroll</strong> made their public debut as a couple on Thursday, June 6 at AFI's 41st Life Achievement Award Gala in Hollywood. The Parks and Recreation actress, 41, who announced her separation from husband <a href=#><strong>Will Arnett</strong></a> last fall, walked the red carpet alone — but the Comedy Central star, 35, later joined Poeher at her table. The pair (<a href=#>Us Weekly</a> <a href=#>broke news</a> of their burgeoning romance in May) were "super close and comfortable," an observer notes, and shared a steak between them.</p><p>"They are so cute together," says the eyewitness, who notes that they were inseparable through the evening. (<strong>Judd Apatow, Sarah Silverman, Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal, Morgan Freeman, Dustin Hoffman, </strong><a href=#><strong>Zach Galifianakis</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a> were among the other guests.)</p><p>"Things are going well," a pal told <strong>Us</strong> of the pair. "They have a lot of fun together obviously and are both real big fans of each other."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Poehler and Arnett <a href=#>announced their separation</a> in September 2012 after nine years of marriage; they share sons Archie, 4, and Abel, 2.</p><p>For his part, Arnett recently told Details. "I'm 43, and I've found my happiness, which is my kids." He added: "I'm not officially dating. I don't know what you do. Do you put out an announcement in the trades? I'M DATING! It all seems very scary to me, to be honest. So I'm kind of keeping pretty close counsel right now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJimsV2lvKa0y56pZqaZmLhut9Goo6VlnZa4pnnPrpmloZNisaau1K1kmqtdmLy2vMueZGtoYWiEdw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ant-man-quantumania-cast.html><span>←</span><span>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Cast and Net Worth</span></a>
