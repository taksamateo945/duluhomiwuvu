He then allegedly threw her on a bed and choked her until she was unconscious.</p><p>When the victim called 911, she told the operator she thought Wheeler was going to kill her. Police arrived to the scene and Wheeler did not comply with officers when they tried to detain him.</p><p>Once Wheeler was detained, he repeatedly yelled that he was sorry and said, "I don't beat women," according to the police report. The victim told police that Wheeler was bipolar and had not been taking his medication at the time of the attack.</p><p>The victim suffered a concussion, fractured humerus and a dislocated elbow as a result of the incident.</p><p>In addition to the prison sentence, Wheeler was also ordered to have no contact with the victim and to pay restitution. His sentence begins immediately.</p><p>Wheeler released an apology on X, formerly known as Twitter, in a <a href=#>since-deleted post</a> following his arrest, writing:</p>"Events happened over the weekend that transpired from a manic episode. I am deeply sorry for the pain and suffering that I have caused to [the woman] and her family. I apologize profusely for the turmoil that I have caused to my family, teammates, fans and those closest to me. The most important thing right now is that [the woman] gets the care she needs and I get help. Both are happening."It is time for me to walk away from football and get the help I need to never again pose a threat to another. I cannot express my sorrow or remorse enough. I am truly ashamed."<p>Wheeler was a member of the Seattle Seahawks at the time of the incident. The franchise waived him after he was arrested.</p><p>The 30-year-old entered the NFL in 2017 as an undrafted free agent out of USC. He spent the 2017 and 2018 seasons with the New York Giants before joining the Seahawks' practice squad in 2019 and active roster in 2020.</p><p><i>If you or someone you know is experiencing or has experienced intimate partner violence, the National Domestic Violence Hotline can be reached at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or TTY: 1-800-787-3224 for free, confidential, 24/7 support.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWaAdoSMnJ%2BanF2staaxy56pZp6fp7qmvoynnaVln6F6qLHTrGRxaV2ivK%2FAx2anq6GjpLtuv8Snq56mk5p6qrqMnaamnaOptqR5wKyqmq2cqXqkrdKe</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lindy-booth-19790402-html.html><span>←</span><span>Lindy Booth (TV Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
