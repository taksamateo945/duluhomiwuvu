And Where Is She Now In 2022?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Colorado is Isabella Guzman’s home state. She was imprisoned in 2013 for 150 times stabbing her mother. She had just turned 18 at the time. Recently, her TikTok video went viral and attracted a lot of attention. Some even held the opinion that she was innocent and deserved to be given justice. She gained a lot of admirers for her “aesthetic face” and “beautiful appearance.”</p><h3>Why Did Isabella Stab Her Mother?</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/isabella-guzman.jpg alt width=640 height=480 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>For reportedly stabbing her mother 79 times, Isabella first made headlines. However, a more thorough examination revealed that the sufferer had more than 151 injuries all all. Investigators discovered that Isabella was different from other kids her age. She didn’t ever want to play, smile, or be with her family.</p><p>She was discovered to have always despised and resented her mother. Many of the things Isabella sought as a child were out of reach for her parents due to their financial situation. The family would argue as a result of this. However, Isabella’s parents believed that as she grew older, she would be more sympathetic to their financial situation.</p><p>After her father left, Isabella moved in with her mother. When her mother began dating Richard, things deteriorated quickly. More tension and arguments resulted from Isabella’s dislike of her father being replaced after she noticed it. Isabella threatened her mother, saying she would “make her pay” for how “she had been abused,” it was discovered.</p><p>Because they were concerned that Isabella would carry out the threats, her mother and boyfriend even told the police about the threats.</p><p>One evening after a disagreement, her father made an effort to persuade Isabella. Richard overheard Isabella’s mother screaming that day from the upstairs restroom. It was locked from the inside as he hurried to assist her. He heard Isabella repeatedly stab his boyfriend while he was still standing there.</p><p>Isabella allegedly stabbed her mother in the face, neck, and chest, according to the authorities. Isabella was disappeared from the crime scene, but undercover police detectives quickly found her.</p><h3>Isabella Suffered From Schizophrenia?</h3><p>Isabella claimed to have internal voices that directed her actions to the detectives. One of the most obvious signs of schizophrenia is frequently this. She asserted that the voices instructed her to kill her mother in order to save the planet.</p><p>She has schizophrenia, according to a doctor’s testimony in Arapahoe County Court. She had been battling with severe Schizophrenic ideas for a long time, according to the doctor. She was declared not guilty due to insanity based on the testimony. She was admitted to Pueblo’s Mental Health Institute when she was 18 years old.</p><h3>Is Isabella Fit To Be Free Now?</h3><p>Since 2020, Isabella has wanted to escape the mental health facility where she has spent more than seven years and re-enter society. Isabella stated, “I was not myself when I did that, and I have since been restored to full health,” in an interview with CBS4 that was conducted over a computer camera inside the facility.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Isabella-Guzman.png alt width=640 height=360 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She discussed her past and her family during the conversation. She claimed, “My relatives molested me at home for many years.” My parents are Jehovah’s Witnesses, and when I left the faith at the age of 14, the abuse at home got worse.</p><p>She expressed regret over the events that had occurred, saying, “If I could reverse everything or turn back time, I would.” When that happened, Isabella said she wasn’t herself, but afterward, her health had fully recovered.</p><h3>Why Did Isabella’s Video Go Viral Now?</h3><p>Instagram users have noticed a trend where short videos of young individuals who have been charged with crimes and murder are played over popular songs, piqueing interest in their backstories. One of these users uploaded this footage of Isabella walking into the courtroom, sitting down, and smiling and frowning at the camera.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1311644.jpg alt width=646 height=405 sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This video gained millions of views after becoming viral. However, such videos of alleged criminals have gone popular before. One such footage of a ‘handsome’ 21-year-old who was sentenced to 24 years in prison for crashing his Ford Mustang into a mother and child while driving too fast went viral. Mother and daughter both passed away.</p><p>Herrin, the little youngster, was reportedly racing his pal while travelling at a speed of more than 100 mph. The victim’s family requested a heavier sentence, but the judge agreed to 24 years in prison instead. Additionally, the expression on Herrin’s face when she heard the verdict quickly became popular on social media, particularly Tiktok.</p><p>All of these videos have one thing in common: the criminal or offender has attractive looks and an aura of mystery about them, which piques everyone’s curiosity, especially Gen Z kids. Even though this kind of attention can have a detrimental effect on people, it also has advantages.</p><h3>Woman Freed After 10 Years In Prison Over Miscarriage</h3><p>Recently, a woman’s story about being imprisoned for supposedly having an abortion became viral on social media. Elsy, a 28-year-old mother and housekeeper, lost a pregnancy, but rather than receiving assistance, she was imprisoned on suspicion of having an abortion. She received a sentence for serious murder. El Salvador freed Elsy and three other women who had been imprisoned for comparable offences following the recent outrage.</p><p>While watching such videos and attempting to decipher the characters’ actions and intentions might be entertaining, it’s important to keep in mind that these are actual people. With the use of social media, we can now connect with people and learn about things that were previously impossible.</p><p>While it is crucial that we avoid becoming engrossed in it, it is encouraging to see social media being utilised for good. However, it’s crucial to keep in mind that just because someone appeared too sweet and innocent, it doesn’t necessarily indicate they aren’t capable of committing horrific atrocities.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
