She’s a sweetie. She’s always been sweet. But I’m super proud of the fact that he actually has taken that step to love openly because I know that the thing was, it was something he didn’t feel like he could do because of where he comes from. So to know that that’s happened and that he’s happy, it’s not about the color or the complexion. You Black or you white, whatever you are, Asian, Chinese, whatever you are, love is love. I think that everybody deserves to be happy. I’m super happy for both of ’em actually.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8mqZ-nhhM-/</p><p>Keyshia and Jeezy’s romance ended in a rather bizarre way with both parties claiming the other had purchased a ring and proposed.</p><p>Cole claimed back then: “I just couldnt do it. Its weird. After this guy proposed to me, I was like, dang, this is everything a woman lives for: to be married, with a ring, to be able to represent something. But for me, it was the opposite. I was scared. When you get married, you become one; you dont live just for yourself anymore. Im just not ready for that. Im not done with my goals in life. Whats the word when you just kind of fall back and let your man do the man thing? Submit? Im all jacked up on that word. I just couldnt submit. But I loved him. Thats the crazy thing about it.”</p><p>Jeezy sang a different tune: “Keyshia asked me to marry her, bought me a ring and everything. She not gonna tell you different. I was grown enough to tell her, ‘Look, baby, that isn’t what it is right now. I’m trying to get my sh-t together. I’m trying to get my money, take care of me and mine.'”</p><p>Cole had this conclusion on the matter: “It was definitely a learning experience, I think for both of us. It’s all good. I respect him in every way, and it’s cool. I’m a just keep it like that and keep it moving.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>At least, things are clear now.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebmsa0tMiaZJynnJp6qa3DZquhoaNiv6atwq2gqKZdqbxuwMeeZKedp6h6tbTArWShnaJisrl5waiwn6qZmrulecmenLOxXZ7AbrHNoJignZRiwbB5yZ6Yp6aZmnqurchmanJuYWiFcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alejandra-fernandez.html><span>←</span><span>Alejandra Fernndez: The Adopted Daughter of Vicente Fernndezc</span></a>
