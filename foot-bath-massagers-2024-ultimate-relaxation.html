Our feet go through a whole lot on a given day, and having the knots kneaded out of them is a treat that often feels well worth shelling out $40 for—at least, every once in a while. But for those whose heels and toes need a little bit more TLC than a bi-weekly salon treatment can offer—and who can’t convince their partner to rub their feet every night (I, for one, have tried and failed)—an at-home foot bath massager is a worthy investment.</p><p>These therapeutic foot baths will not only help you relax in the same way a pro-grade pedicure does, but they can also be helpful for treating foot pain and discomfort. Plus, you don’t have to worry about any of the not-so-great side effects that can come along with dipping your toes into a tub that’s been used by hundreds of other people, like fungus and bacterial infections. And the best part? Most of the options on the market will only cost you as much as one—maybe&nbsp;two—trips to the salon.</p><p>With a range of features like heat, bubbles, vibration, and rollers, there are&nbsp;tons&nbsp;of options on the market that can meet you—and your feet’s—individual needs. Keep scrolling to find the ones worth shopping for.</p><h2>Best foot bath massagers, at a glance</h2><ul><li><strong>Best overall:</strong> Ivation, Foot Spa Massager, $65</li><li><strong>Best foot spa with heat:</strong> HoMedics, Shiatsu Footbath with Heat Boost, $140</li><li><strong>Best portable foot spa massager:</strong> Hospan, Collapsible Foot Spa Bath Massager, $40</li><li><strong>Best vibrating:</strong> Conair, Soothing Pedicure Foot Spa Bath with Soothing Vibration Massage, $35</li><li><strong>Best foot massager with automatic rollers:</strong> Best Choice Products, Motorized Foot Spa Bath Massager, $60</li><li><strong>Best foot massager for plantar fasciitis:</strong> MaxKare, Foot Spa/Bath Massager, $70</li><li><strong>Best for pedicures:</strong> UNIFULL, Collapsible Foot Spa Bath with Heat and Massage Rollers, $37</li></ul><h2>Shop the best home foot bath massagers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/71cn1EDhkgL._AC_SL1500__falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best overall: Ivation, Foot Spa Massager — $65.00</p><p>Of all the foot bath massagers on the market, this one’s the best of the best.

This handy device collapses down into a nearly-flat 3.5 inches, making it easy to hide under the couch or take on the go. Additionally, the handle makes for easy transport, and the draining function makes cleaning a breeze. Of course, it’s still got all of the most important stuff you’ll want from a foot massager, including eight massage rollers, controllable heat, bubbles, and LED light.</p><ul><li>Collapsible for seamless transport and storage</li><li>Drain feature makes for easy cleaning</li><li>Features heat, bubbles, eight massage rollers, and LED light</li><li>Built-in pumice stone for exfoliation and callus removal</li><li>Timer can be set from 10 to 60 minutes</li><li>Temperature control (95°F-118°F)</li></ul><ul><li>Temperature may fluctuate</li></ul><p><span class="inline text-h5 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/71ubYegfKIL._AC_SL1500__falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best foot massager with automatic rollers: Best Choice Products, Motorized Foot Spa Bath Massager — $60.00</p><p>What makes this foot massager stand out is the fact that it’s equipped with two types of massage rollers: Wheels that hit on your arches and nubbed circles that deliver shiatsu-inspired acupressure to your heels and toes. It’s also super deep, delivering a nice treat for your feet and calves—and the built-in, three-direction shower head will ensure the water never, ever gets cold.</p><ul><li>Massage rollers, heat, bubbles, LED light</li><li>Timer can be set from 10-60 mintes</li><li>Controllable temperature (95 – 118 ℉)</li><li>Drainage hose for easy cleaning</li><li>Lid and lockable wheels for easy transport</li></ul><ul><li>Some reviewers have said the bath is too small for their feet to fit comfortably</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/foot-spabath-massager-with-14-massage-rollers-and-heat-bubbles-vibration-digital-temperature-control-pedicure-tub-bath-soothe-feet-fathers-day-gift-122126.webp><p>Best foot massager for plantar fasciitis: MaxKare, Foot Spa/Bath Massager — $70.00</p><p>A lot of the foot baths on this list come with massage rollers, but none have more than this pick—which has a whopping 16 of ’em. The small rollers (eight for each foot) are optimally placed to hit all of the most important spots on your soles, and because they aren’t automatic (meaning you’ll have to move them yourself), you’ll have full control over the speed and pressure. Overall, you’ll get a gentle, ultra-targeted massage that’s perfect for plantar’s fasciitis.</p><ul><li>14 massage rollers, bubbles, heat, vibration</li><li>Temperature control (95°F to 118°F)</li><li>Ultra-targeted massage</li></ul><ul><li>Rollers don’t move automatically</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/71fVKkAeGL._AC_SL1500_-1_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best for pedicures: UNIFULL, Collapsible Foot Spa Bath with Heat and Massage Rollers — $37.00</p><p>Looking to go beyond the massage and treat yourself to a full-blown at-home pedicure? Well, this foot bath has everything you need. Though the massage rollers aren’t automatic (meaning you’ll have to move them with your feet), there’s something to be said about the ridged foot bed, which offers acupressure massage even when you aren’t working with the rollers. Even better, for $37 you’ll get the heated-and-bubbling foot bath along with a foot file, a callus remover, scraper, and shaver; a cuticle remover and pushing stick; a nail brush; and a metal nail file.</p><ul><li>Bubbles, heat, vibration</li><li>Controllable temperature (100°F~117°F)</li><li>Includes a full pedicure kit</li><li>Includes a cover</li></ul><ul><li>Takes 15 minutes to heat (or longer if uncovered)</li><li>Rollers are not automatic</li></ul><h2>The benefits of foot baths</h2><p>Experts are constantly shouting the benefits of soaking your feet in warm water, and it’s for good reason.</p><p>When muscles are knotty or inflamed—which, in the case of your feet, can happen simply as a result of walking around all day—they need oxygen to recover, which is where foot baths come in.</p><p>“Soaking feet in hot water reduces inflammation and stimulates circulation, which helps with cell recovery,” Gilma Linares, a massage therapist and the&nbsp;assistant spa manager of Four Seasons Hotel Los Angeles, previously told Well+Good, adding that these effects expand well beyond your heels and toes. “It will help reduce pain or discomfort to lower extremities such as lower back, hips, and legs.”</p><p>And considering your feet carry&nbsp;all&nbsp;of your body’s weight, I think we can all agree they’ve earned their fair share of pampering.</p><h2>How do foot bath massagers help in relieving foot pain?</h2><p>While simply soaking your feet in warm water can help relieve foot pain, many foot baths take things to the next level by incorporating some sort of massaging mechanism. This can come in the form of rollers, bubbles, gentle vibration, or some combination of the three.</p><p>“Foot baths that incorporate a massager can help with foot pain by increasing circulation in the foot to help expedite healing and shorten recovery time,” says Nam Tran, DPM, a podiatrist based in Dallas.</p><p>He’s a fan of foot baths with massage rollers, which “can help stimulate better circulation in the foot as well as loosen up the soft tissue structures on the bottom of the feet that may be causing tightness and discomfort,” he says.</p><h2>Are heated foot spas more effective for relaxation?</h2><p>Adding heat to your therapeutic foot bath treatment can also help, and many devices on the market come with temperature-control features.</p><p>“Heat can be more effective in relaxing and healing foot ailments by dilating the blood vessels and bringing blood and the necessary healing factors to the feet,” says Dr. Tran. “Always look for a foot bath that has the ability to control the temperature, as having this control can prevent any injury and possible burns.”</p><p>What’s more, the enhanced sensory experience that comes along with warm water has been shown to relieve stress—both in your muscles and your mind—so a heated experience can help make things even more relaxing.</p><h2>What features should I look for in a foot bath massager?</h2><p>A few potential features to look for when considering investing in a device for an at-home foot facial:</p><ul><li>Massage rollers</li><li>Bubbles</li><li>Gentle vibration</li><li>Temperature control</li><li>Removable well or drain for easy cleaning</li><li>LED light to reduce nerve pain and promote healing</li><li>Collapsibility (if you’re looking for something portable or easy to store in small spaces)</li><li>Easy-to-read LED display</li><li>Toe-touch capabilities (meaning you can adjust the temperature and setting with your feet!)</li></ul><h2>Can foot bath massagers help with plantar fasciitis?</h2><p>Plantar fasciitis, an extremely common foot injury that affects 10 percent of people over the course of their lifetime, happens when the&nbsp;fascia—AKA connective tissue—within the base of the foot becomes&nbsp;inflamed. It can be&nbsp;horribly uncomfortable, and while foot bath massagers may not be able to cure it, they can certainly make it easier to live with.</p><p>“Foot baths can help relieve some of the pain associated with plantar fasciitis, but it is not a replacement for good stretching exercises that are used to treat plantar fasciitis,” says Dr. Tran. For best results, pair your regular foot bath massages with regular stretching and mechanical massage, and consider working with a podiatrist to implement other pro-approved treatments.</p><h2>How often can I use a foot bath massager?</h2><p>There’s no such thing as “too much” when it comes to using your foot bath massager—according to Dr. Tran, it’s totally fine to treat yourself every day. That said, “foot baths should not exceed 15 to 20 minutes at a time,” he cautions. “Any more time could cause the skin to be more friable and prone to injury and infection.”</p><p>Our editors independently select these products.
