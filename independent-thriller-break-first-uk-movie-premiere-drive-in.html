We didn’t know when or where we could release our film.</p><p>“After 10 years of hard work we wanted to give the film a premiere it deserved. We then thought an open-air drive-in would be the perfect place to host our event and would be the spring board to roll out the film nationwide.</p><p>“We are delighted to be able to release ‘Break’ at Brent Cross Drive-In Club. The public will be able to have a great night out with safe and secure procedures in place.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Following the premiere, “Break” will be rolled out to other drive-in venues across the UK, starting with Sheffield at the World Snooker Championships. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Will you be going to see “Break” when it is released?
