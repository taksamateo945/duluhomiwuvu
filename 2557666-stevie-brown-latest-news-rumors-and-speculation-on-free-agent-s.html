He's undoubtedly aware of the injuries to&nbsp;</span>Bennett Jackson<span>,&nbsp;</span>Nat Berhe<span>,&nbsp;</span>Justin Currie<span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span>Mykkele Thompson<span>&nbsp;and the fact that the likely starters in Saturday's preseason game—</span>Brandon Meriweather&nbsp;<span>and&nbsp;</span>Landon Collins—<span>are both strong safeties.</span></p><p><span>Brown's greatest success in the NFL came with the Giants in 2012, when he recorded eight interceptions.</span></p><p><span>The 28-year-old isn't immune to injuries, as he missed the entire 2013 season after tearing his ACL. He did return to play in all 16 games last season, making eight starts, though he struggled in pass coverage. Pro Football Focus (via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Powell</a> of NJ.com) noted opposing quarterbacks had a 70.3 completion percentage against him.</span></p><p><span>At this point in the preseason, the Giants are desperate for bodies. Brown may not be the player he was before his knee injury, but New York's coaching staff knows him well and can work around those limitations.&nbsp;<br></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW5tZ2uDd3nSrZyvoZVir7O71qdkpZmkmsC1ec2erqxloqq6sL7SZpinnF2ovaav1KWYraGfo3qwuoyfqZ6dXZa0prrTZqo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./morgan-harvey.html><span>←</span><span>Morgan Harvey: American Chef, Food Blogger, and Cookbook Author</span></a>
