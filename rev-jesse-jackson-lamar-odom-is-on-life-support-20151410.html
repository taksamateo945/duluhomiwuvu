Jesse Jackson: Lamar Odom Is on Life Support</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Following his visit with <strong>Lamar Odom </strong>on Wednesday, Oct. 14, civil rights icon <strong>Rev. Jesse Jackson </strong>gave an update to reporters about the NBA player’s condition after he was found <a href=#>unconscious</a> on Tuesday in a Nevada brothel.</p><p>Jackson confirmed to reporters that Odom, 35, is currently on life support — but has shown signs of responsiveness. “Doctors felt he is much better off today than he was yesterday,” Jackson told the <a href=#>Orange County Register</a> outside of Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas. “At least there is some responsiveness now.”</p><p>According to the paper’s Los Angeles Lakers beat reporter <strong>Bill Oram</strong>, Jackson was hopeful about Odom’s condition.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Jackson: “We get knocked down sometimes, we get back up again. The ground is no place for a champion. Champions rise.”</p><p>— Bill Oram (@billoram) <a href=#>October 14, 2015</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Jackson: “Hopefully he will somehow double that championship spirit and rise again.”</p><p>— Bill Oram (@billoram) <a href=#>October 14, 2015</a></p><p>As previously reported, Odom’s <a href=#>estranged wife,<strong> Khloe Kardashian</strong></a>, was “inconsolable” and rushed to be by his side on Tuesday, where she <a href=#>remained overnight</a>. A rep for the L.A. County Superior Court confirmed to <strong>Us</strong> on Wednesday that a judge has yet to sign off on the couple’s divorce documents, so they’re still legally bound in marriage.</p><p>“It was a great joy to see her giving him embraces, giving him care and being by his side…” Jackson told reporters of Kardashian. “She’s strong and she’s hopeful and she’s acting and loving and by his side.”</p><p>Kardashian filed for divorce in December 2013, and signed the documents with Odom this past July. Jackson told reporters on Wednesday that Kardashian <a href=#>hasn’t budged from Odom’s side</a>. “[She is] so serious and when he does wake up, he will see her right there in the room with him,” Jackson said. “We certainly hope he comes out of this, it seems he will.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Kardashian <a href=#>has also been joined at the hospital</a> by her mom, <strong>Kris Jenner,</strong> and pregnant older sister <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>. A source close to the Kardashians told<strong> Us </strong>on Wednesday that Odom suffered several strokes overnight. The same insider revealed that ” a significant amount of cocaine was found in his system.”</p><p>Jackson also revealed that other former teammates and childhood friends have stopped by the hospital to see Odom, including <strong>Kobe Bryant</strong>. The Lakers standout abruptly left the team’s game in Vegas on Tuesday night.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re just holding hands and hoping he can bounce back,” Jackson concluded.</p><p>Meanwhile, Odom’s rep released an exclusive statement to<strong> Us Weekly</strong> early Wednesday morning. “Family and friends are extremely concerned for Lamar,” the athlete’s longtime publicist and friend, <strong>Eve Sarkisyan</strong>, told <strong>Us.</strong> “Please don’t listen to the false information being circulated unofficially. Please respect the family’s privacy during this difficult time.”</p><p>For more details about Odom, watch the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmerl2fsrS%2FxGahmpubqLyvecuapJqqXaSxsLmMoqpmp55iuaqyxGaqrqigpL%2B1eZFpaG5pZGZ9</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-years-eve-traditions.html><span>←</span><span>25 Unique New Year's Eve Traditions From Around the World</span></a>
