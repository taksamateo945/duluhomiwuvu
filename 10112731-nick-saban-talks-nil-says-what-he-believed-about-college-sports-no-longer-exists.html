Saban explained.</p><p>The discussion was hosted by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Other participants included Saban's former boss, Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne, ACC commissioner Jim Phillips and student-athletes Haley and Hanna Cavinder. Haley is planning to return to college basketball next season with TCU.</p><p>Saban <a href=# rel=noopener>stepped down</a> as Alabama head coach in January after leading the team to six national championships in 17 seasons.</p><p>The 72-year-old went on to advocate for a revenue-sharing model that would benefit student-athletes while also creating a better competitive balance.</p><p>"If we had some sort of revenue sharing proposition that did not make student-athletes employees ... I think that may be the long-term solution," Saban <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>. "You could create a better quality of life for student-athletes, you could still emphasize development, you can still create brand and athletic development with a system like that and it would be equal in all institutions. You couldn't raise more money at one school to create a competitive advantage at another."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWeEdH2Mp6Cco12orqOtzWarmqSbqHqvtctmqpqxo2LEqa3TZp%2BeZZKauaqx1Z6bZpmSpMK1ecKoo6Wdl5p6tLzOq6usZZ6keq27zaCcq2WVrba0wNI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./us-capitol-police-addresses-threats-to-disrupt-congressional-baseball-game.html><span>←</span><span>US Capitol Police addresses threats to disrupt Congressional Baseball Game</span></a>
