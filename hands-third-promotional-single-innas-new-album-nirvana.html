We’re so excited for “Nirvana” to drop, it’s been a long wait for this album; one that has certainly been worth it as she continues to release promotional singles. These songs are certainly something new and different, showing the tropical direction she has been going in."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

These songs are certainly something new and different, showing the tropical direction she has been going in.</p><p>Once again, “Hands Up” is something new and different. A lyric video was dropped on INNA’s official YouTube Channel alongside the promotional single release. We watch as INNA has fun amongst desert sands with her crew.</p><h3>Watch INNA’s Lyric Video To “Hands Up” Here:</h3><p></p><p>The song is a great follow-up to “<a href=#>Tropical</a>” as they both have that sort of vibe to the songs. This one certainly has a more club-like sound to it, something we’ve come to expect from this female Romanian singer.</p><p>It’s a hypnotic addicting track, that contains a lot of falsetto from INNA, which gives this tranquil club vibe that is going to be flat-out amazing at one of her gigs. The lyrics are full of metaphors creating this space-like image about love. If this becomes an official single with a music video, we expect INNA to take us to space!</p><h3>Stream INNA’s “Hands Up” Here:</h3><p>“Hands Up” is available to download and stream, right now, on all platforms. It was released by Global Records. Her other promotional singles are available too. We’ll be writing up about each of her promotional singles this week, so keep watch on CelebMix.</p><h4>What do you make of INNA’s promo single “Hands Up”?
