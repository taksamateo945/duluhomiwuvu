Here's what Brock said to me, he said 'I'll tell you what. After my surgery from diverticulitis, this last surgery I had, I have never felt so good in my life.' He said 'I've had the best camp I've ever had, no injuries, I was in great shape. All the things that could go right went right. That guy is just that much better than me, and it's time to retire.'"</p><p>Lesnar's decision to call it quits looms heavily over the <a href=#>MMA</a> world. As a former world champion and perennial top-10 heavyweight, it's easy to forget that Lesnar has only had eight fights in his professional career.
