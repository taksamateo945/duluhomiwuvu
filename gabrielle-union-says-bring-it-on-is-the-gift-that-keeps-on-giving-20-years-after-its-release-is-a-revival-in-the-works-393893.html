But, no matter how long it has been, the 47-year-old says the movie is the “gift that keeps on giving.”</p><p>During a recent appearance on Good Morning America, Union told Robin Roberts that the Netflix docu-series Cheer is one of the reasons that Bring It On is still popular two decades after its release. The original Bring It On told the story of two cheerleading captains – Union as the captain of a squad in East Compton known as the Clovers and Dunst as the captain of the Toros, a squad in San Diego.</p><p></p><p>The drama begins when new Toros captain Torrance Shipman (Dunst) seemingly discovers that Isis (Union) and her squad have stolen a big cheerleading routine that they were planning to take to competition. But, it turns out that the routine wasn’t theirs at all. The previous Toros captain, Big Red, had been stealing routines from the Clovers for years.</p><p>“It just keeps bringing it back and fortunately, or unfortunately, the issues surrounding cultural appropriation have stayed completely relevant and it makes the movie relevant,” said Union.</p><p>While five direct-to-video sequels followed in subsequent years, none of them featured the original cast members. Union said earlier this year that she would be open to the idea of doing a sequel because fans have been wanting one with the original cast, director, and writers. She says that every so often they “toss those ideas around,” but nothing has come of it yet.</p><p>After Netflix’s Cheer and its star Jerry Harris had such massive success, Union believes there are people who would like to see another take from a different perspective in a Bring It On sequel.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4NdRfOJ48J/</p><p>“We’re always all open to it, that would be really awesome,” said Union.</p><p>Gabrielle Union’s Bring It On co-star, Kirsten Dunst, is also on board for a sequel. During an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show in September 2019, Dunst said that if they wanted to make another movie, she would do it because “it’d be so fun.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“Kirsten and I are down,” revealed Union in February. “I think all the original players are super open and down and willing.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeXlq%2BztcSlo55lpaO2sLqMrJiyq12Xv6q6xmagrWWfo3qqv4ytn55ll56ztXnToZitZZuasrG%2FjKilZp%2BZq7avs4xrZ2axlZa%2FtHnAn6ueql2ewbR50Z6jnpmjmnqqv4yaZKudpp7DoriMoqVmrJiaeri70aSqZmtpaIV6f44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-mlbs-diamondbacks-on-a-sports-ticker-html.html><span>←</span><span>The MLB's Diamondbacks on a sports ticker</span></a>
