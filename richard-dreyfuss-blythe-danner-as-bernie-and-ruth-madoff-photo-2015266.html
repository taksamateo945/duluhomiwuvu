<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Richard Dreyfuss, Blythe Danner as Bernie and Ruth Madoff: Photo</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Mr. and Mrs. Madoff, ladies and gentlemen. ABC released the first photo from its upcoming miniseries, Madoff, starring <strong>Richard Dreyfuss </strong>as white-collar criminal<strong> Bernie Madoff</strong> and <strong>Blythe Danner </strong>as his wife<strong> Ruth.</strong></p><p>The snap features Dreyfuss, 67, as the former stockbroker and financial adviser, who swindled thousands of investors in his notorious Ponzi scheme. While Madoff is <a href=#>currently serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison</a> in Butner, N.C. — the maximum time allowed in the system — and still facing lawsuits from victims, the photo of Dreyfuss shows the former financier living the high life in NYC with his wife.</p><p>In the photo, Danner, 72, swaps her trademark wavy tresses for Ruth Madoff's sleek blonde bob. The actress wears a classic white T-shirt underneath a lilac blazer, paired with a scarf, triple strand of pearls, and Ruth's trademark rounded black-frame glasses.</p><p>Dreyfuss transforms into Madoff with his thin square frames, wispy hairstyle, and a tailored pale blue blazer. The two look like they're hanging out in a posh country club. The miniseries, the first portrayal of the Madoff scandal, is based on ABC News Chief Investigative Correspondent<strong> Brian Ross</strong>' book, The Madoff Chronicles. The series will follow the rise and fall of Madoff, as well as the effect his actions had on his close family, friends, and employees.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sadly, Madoff's eldest son, <strong>Mark</strong>, committed suicide back in 2010 by hanging himself in his NYC apartment on the second anniversary of his father's arrest. Madoff's youngest son,<strong> Andrew</strong>, died in September 2014 after losing his fight with lymphoma.</p><p><a href=#>In an email from prison</a> this past January, Madoff wrote: "As difficult as it is for me to live with the pain I have inflicted on so many, there is nothing to compare with the degree of pain I endure with the loss of my sons Mark and Andy. I live with the knowledge that they never forgave me for betraying their love and trust… The fact that I was trying to protect our family by sheltering them from any knowledge or involvement in my wrongdoing still fails to allow me to forgive myself."</p><p>Other actors confirmed as part of the series include <strong>Frank Whaley</strong> as investigator <strong>Harry Markopolos</strong>, <strong>Erin Cummings</strong> as Madoff's secretary<strong> Eleanor Squillari,</strong> <strong>Tom Lipinski</strong> as Mark Madoff, <strong>Lyne Renee</strong> as <strong>Catherine Hooper</strong>, <strong>Charles Grodin </strong>as Bernie's friend and victim <strong>Carl Shapiro</strong>, and<strong> Lewis Black</strong> as Madoff's co-conspirator<strong> Ezra Merkin</strong>. The project is directed by <strong>Raymond De Felitta</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmim5iWv6V5w6ucsp6lqMBursuyq6GdXZmur7rEq2Saq12XsrO6yJ5kmqaUYr%2B2wMdmpJqcn5uzbrzHqKuoZWJlfnZ%2BlW8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./holly-montag-marries-hills-wedding-dress-heidi-montag-2014159.html><span>←</span><span>Holly Montag Marries: See Hills Star's Wedding Dress, Heidi Montag</span></a>
