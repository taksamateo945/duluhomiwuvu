After her high school graduation, Maggie made the move to Nashville on a quest to further improve her writing and performing.&nbsp;The Canadian singer has already been winning over audiences worldwide, with over 13 million views on YouTube, and also secured a record deal with Linus Entertainment.</p><p>In November 2012, Maggie released her debut album Now Hear Me Out. She co-wrote all of the songs,&nbsp;with production by Justin Gray (Joss Stone), Gavin Bradley (Nelly Furtado) and Tanya Leah. ‘Lovesick’, the first single from the album, led to Maggie being named as Bell Media’s Emerging Artist. She was also personally&nbsp;chosen by famed blogger Perez Hilton as his “Can YOU Sing?” contest winner, hailing&nbsp;Maggie as a superstar on the rise.</p><p></p><p>Since living in Los Angeles, Maggie has been able to perform sold-out shows at some prestigious venues, including the infamous Viper Room, House of Blues and Hotel Café. More music followed, in the form of ‘Tidal Waves and Hurricanes’, with the music video premiering exclusively with Ryan Seacrest.</p><p>In 2014, Maggie won in the Best Pop category at the Toronto Independent Music Awards, whilst she was most recently the Pop/Top 40 winner for the International Songwriting Competition. Her single ‘Forgive and Forget’ was also premiered on Yahoo Music and&nbsp;featured by Jay-Z’s music platform ‘Tidal’. Not only has Maggie recorded and released her own music, but she also&nbsp;features on German electronic DJ Schiller’s album.</p><p></p><p>Maggie has also kept fans up to date with new music by unveiling tracks on Soundcloud. One of our favourites is ‘Gold’, which instantly hooks you with its strong sound. It’s a&nbsp;bold pop-rock song with an anthemic chorus&nbsp;that&nbsp;you’ll be shouting at the top of your lungs.</p><p>In contrast, ‘Smile’ is a lot more subdued and pulls on your heartstrings. Talking about the song with <a href=#>Huffington Post</a>, Maggie said: “This song was inspired by someone I was in love with for a very long time, but it was a relationship that just couldn’t work. I remember wishing I could delete the memories from my brain so I could just move on with my life, but unfortunately it wasn’t that easy. I had to face the fact that there wasn’t some magical cure, or a simple solution to get over someone; the only thing that I could do is let time do its work.”</p><p>Maggie’s sound is well-rounded and she has proven that she can deliver both emotional ballads and bold anthems. Along with her emotive music, she has acquired a strong&nbsp;fanbase, which will no doubt continue to grow as she continues her musical journey. We look forward to hearing what Maggie Szabo delivers next.</p><p>Are you a fan of Maggie Szabo?
