He was born on July 29, 1999. After Hartman declares for the 2024 NFL Draft, he will be a 25-year-old rookie at the start of his first NFL season.</p><p>Hartman quickly garnered a reputation as the “elder statesman” within Notre Dame’s locker room upon transferring from Wake Forest. But his experience isn’t something that materialized out of thin air.</p><p>Hartman has been taking starting QB reps in some capacity since the 2018 season. He earned the starting job as a true freshman and threw for almost 2,000 yards, 16 touchdowns, and eight interceptions before a leg injury ended his season.</p><p>It would take two years for Hartman to return to the full-time starting role for the Demon Deacons. But once he did, he didn’t look back. In 2021, Hartman threw for 4,228 yards, 39 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions. In 2022, he added 3,701 yards and 38 touchdowns and earned the Brian Piccolo Award — given to the “most courageous player” in the ACC.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>College Football QB Rankings</a></strong></p><p>Courage, and resilience, have been big parts of Hartman’s journey to this point. Not only did Hartman work back from a major injury as an underclassman in 2019, but he also dealt with a blood clot issue ahead of the 2022 season and underwent surgery as a result.</p><p>Adversity has only ever delayed Hartman, and never stopped him. As of this writing, Hartman is fifth all-time in collegiate passing yards, and seventh all-time in collegiate passing touchdowns. He needs four more passing TDs to crack the top five and seven more to crack the top three.</p><h2>Sam Hartman’s 2024 NFL Draft Scouting Report</h2><p>Hartman won’t be an early-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. But the storied college football competitor has established a reputation as a top-flight competitor and team leader. Those qualities could help him earn a late-round selection and a backup job in the NFL.</p><p>Hartman’s 2024 NFL Draft Scouting Report says the following about his ability on the field, and how it translates to the professional level:</p><p>“Hartman does have coveted qualities as a potential backup. He’s mobile enough, with enough athleticism and arm elasticity to operate off-platform. He’s incredibly poised in the pocket, with the steely resolve to stand tall amidst pressure.</p><p>He processes and navigates well, has good discretion as a decision-maker, and has a degree of accuracy and situational precision. And his competitive toughness in all phases serves as a bonus.”</p><p>You can view Hartman’s <a href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>full 2024 NFL Draft scouting report</a> — complete with strengths and weaknesses — at Pro Football Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5prPEn6aorJKWua26xK2uqKqbY7CwuY6wn5qsXZ7Abr%2FApmShmaKpuqK60maYoJ1dnby4ec6lm2aho2LBqbGMp6atqpVisaK5xGaom2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lorenzo-zurzolo-bio-family-relationship-career.html><span>←</span><span>Lorenzo Zurzolo- Bio, Family, Relationship &amp;amp; Career</span></a>
