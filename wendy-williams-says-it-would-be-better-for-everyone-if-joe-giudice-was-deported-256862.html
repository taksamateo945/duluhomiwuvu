She is still young enough and attractive. She is a hustler, not the smartest, but she still has a name.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Williams even argued that the daughters will not necessarily be affected by having no dad in the house since many others grow up like that and they do just fine in life.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGenmrulxYywoKWkmZa6tHnSmrCsZZmperi71KWbZpqVYq%2BmwNOeqWaen6d6psLEq7CoppVitqd5yaicZp%2BZqrGqr8RmrpqrXZmysbvRrZydZWJqg3mCkWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-the-american-tourist-killed-in-germany.html><span>←</span><span>Who is the American tourist killed in Germany?</span></a>
