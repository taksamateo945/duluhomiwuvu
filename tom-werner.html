Its 89–73 record was then the second best in franchise history. After a pair of winning seasons with third-place finishes in 1991 and 1992, the team fell precipitously into the NL West cellar at 61–101 in 1993, six games behind the expansion Colorado Rockies.

The publicity stunt was met with condemnation from baseball fans and sportswriters, some of whom called it either the “Barr-Mangled Banner” or the “Barr-Strangled Banner.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Tom Werner height</b> Not available right now.

The so-called Fire Sale of 1993 began on August 31, 1992, when Craig Lefferts was traded to the Baltimore Orioles. In the offseason, Randy Myers and Benito Santiago were allowed to become free agents, Tony Fernández and Mike Maddux were dealt to the New York Mets and Jerald Clark was selected by the Rockies in the expansion draft. Gary Sheffield was sent to the Marlins on June 24, 1993, Fred McGriff was shipped to the Atlanta Braves. Bruce Hurst and Greg Harris were moved to the Rockies on July 26. The trade of Darrin Jackson to the Toronto Blue Jays on March 30, 1993, resulted in a class action filed against the Padres. During the previous December, the team sent a letter to season-ticket holders assuring them that the maximum effort would be made to retain Jackson. Economic circumstances changed, however, after Jackson won a $2.1-million arbitration award in February. Refunds were offered to ticket holders involved in the lawsuit.</p><h2>Who is Tom Werner Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Tom Werner</strong> married to <strong>Jill Werner </strong>.
