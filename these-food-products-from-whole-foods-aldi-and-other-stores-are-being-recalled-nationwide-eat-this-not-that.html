The problem lies in the Pickled Curry Cauliflower included in the meal which is produced by Georgia-based company Doux South Specialties, LLC.</p><p>The packaged meal was distributed to Whole Foods stores in all states across the U.S., with the exception of Hawaii. Production and distribution of the product to Whole Foods stores has since been halted and the FDA is continuing to work with Doux South Specialties, LLC to determine the initial source of the problem. Those who purchased the product are urged to not consume it and are eligible for a full refund from Whole Foods.</p><p>Luckily, no illnesses from the product have been reported thus far. However, the CDC states <i>Listeria</i> could be a life-threatening infection and certain groups are at a higher risk including “pregnant women and their newborns, older adults, and people with immune systems weakened by cancer, cancer treatments, or other serious conditions.” Symptoms of someone infected with <i>Listeria</i> include fever, headache, stiffness, nausea, stomach pain, and diarrhea.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/themes/eatthis/img/etnt-logo.png alt="Eat this, not that" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><br>To get all the latest grocery store and recall news delivered right to your email inbox every day, sign up for our newsletter:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/themes/eatthis/img/etnt-logo.png><p>Another item sold at Whole Foods as well as low-cost chains ALDI and Lidl is being pulled from shelves over fears it could contain <i>Listeria, </i>according to a notice posted by the FDA. The Hippie Organics French Beans come in a 1-pound clear plastic bag. Those included in the recall also feature a lot number of <i>313-626</i>.</p><p>Anyone who purchased the beans in a Whole Foods store in Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, or Maryland, an ALDI store in Florida, or a Lidl store in Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, or Virginia is urged to return the package to the store for a full refund. Routine testing found the vegetable could be contaminated. No illnesses have been reported as of April 22.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Whole-Foods-ALDI-LIdl-French-Beans-recall.jpg><p>Unfortunately, the most recent recall announcements aren’t limited to food items. For those that cook at home, Insignia brand Digital Air Fryers, Analog Air Fryers, and Digital Air Fryer Ovens are also being recalled after over 100 reports across the U.S. and Canada of the products “catching fire, burning or melting”. In some cases, injuries and minor property damage were also reported.<span aria-hidden=true>6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e</span></p><p>According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, around 635,000 of the potentially dangerous air fryers and air fryer ovens are present in the U.S. These products have been sold at Best Buy stores nationwide as well as through the store’s online platform, eBay, and Google.</p><p>“Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled air fryers and air fryer ovens and return the product to Best Buy for a refund in the form of a credit for use at Best Buy stores or Bestbuy.com,” the Consumer Product Safety Commission states.</p><p>Visit the Best Buy site for more information on how to identify the affected Insignia models and how to get a full refund.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Best-Buy-Insignia-Air-Fryer.jpg><p>In the case of the Red Lentil Dal and the French Beans, even after a recall and potentially dangerous food item is removed from your home, it’s best to take a few precautions to ensure that everything is safe and clean. Bacteria like <i>Salmonella</i> can last on surfaces for 36 hours! According to <i>Eat This, Not That!</i> Medical Expert Board member, registered dietitian, and a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> best-selling cookbook author Toby Amidor, a great way to do this is to follow a two-step system to clean and sanitize your space.</p><p>The first step involves washing your kitchen surfaces and any other items that may have come into contact with a possible contaminated food. Use soapy water and a single-use disposable paper towel or a towel you will then machine wash to wipe them clean. Then wash your hands.</p><p>The next step is to sanitize and this can be done with a homemade mixture of 1 tablespoon of liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water, or a commercial sanitizer or wipe. Use whichever you have to ripe the surfaces and/or follow the directions.</p><p>For more on this, here are&nbsp;11 Bad Kitchen Habits You Need To Stop Immediately.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82uq6uhpJ68r3vToZysnV2bvLCwjKmpqJylmMG0ecWrpqZlp528rbGMn6aonKNirq2wyGaYp5xdpMGpsdFmqq2noprAbq3RnmSbnZmjtG6%2BxJyYpaSVmXqvrdOipqevmZmybrHArWStoJmoeq%2B702aroZmkZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chef-jordan-brady-wife-five-star-chef-married-to.html><span>←</span><span>Chef Jordan Brady Wife: Who Is The Five Star Chef Married To?</span></a>
