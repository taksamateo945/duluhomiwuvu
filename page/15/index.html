Consequently, tattoos on “One Piece,” written and illustrated by Japanese manga artist Eiichira Oda, are typically meant to brand a character as part of some larger organization, like Nami’s Arlong Pirates tattoo or Jinbe’s Sun Pirates tattoo.
Notable exceptions do exist, but it’s within a framework of narrative significance. For instance,&nbsp;Luffy (sort of) bears a tattoo on his right bicep that marks how long his crew will be separated before reuniting under the Straw Hat Pirate banner.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Welcome Their Second Child</h2><time>May 6, 2024</time>
